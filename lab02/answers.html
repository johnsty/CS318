                The DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning of every html document is used to let the web browser know what markup language is being used, so it can successfuly read it

                The h1 tag has the biggest text and seems to be bold. As you move down (from h1 to h2 and h2 to h3), the size of the font gets smaller. It also adds a margin to the text to give it some space above and below the text.

            <li>
                Each li tag is tabbed over, and the elements are ordered using numeric numbers from least to greatest.
