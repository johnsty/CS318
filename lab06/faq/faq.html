            <h3>What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can run the 64-bit versions of Windows.
