            <h1>Lamborghini Aventador</h1><hr>
            The Lamborghini Aventador is a mid-engined sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini.
            Launched on 28 February 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, five months after its initial unveiling in Sant'Agata Bolognese, the vehicle, internally codenamed LB834, was designed to replace the then-decade-old Murciélago as the new flagship model.
            Soon after the Aventador's unveiling, Lamborghini announced that it had already sold 12 cars, with deliveries starting in the second half of 2011. By March 2016, Lamborghini had already built 5,000 Aventadors, taking five years to achieve this milestone.

            <h1>Background</h1><hr>
            In keeping with Lamborghini tradition, the Aventador is named after a fighting bull. Aventador (pronounced [aβentaˈðoɾ]) was a bull that fought particularly valiantly in the bull ring of Zaragoza, Spain in 1993. The bull which the Aventador is named after earned the Trofeo de la Peña La Madroñera for its courage in the arena.

Known internally as the L539, the new engine is Lamborghini's fourth in-house engine and second V12 design. It is the first all-new V12 since the 3.5 litre powerplant found in the 350GT.
