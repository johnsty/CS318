            My third day in my fake trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, was going whale watching off of the Waikiki Beach. This was really fun. I got to meet a bunch of people and I actually didn't get to see a whale. But here is a picture anyways:

            After whale watching, I wanted to learn how to surf. I have never done it before. By the end of the day, I was really good as you can see by this photo.

            My instructor was really good, and that's why I got to be so good at the end of the day. I think I should go and join some professional club.
