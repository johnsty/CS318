            My second day I decided to visit Pearl Harbor. I'm not a person who's obsessed with morbid tragedies, but I thought this would be an interesting place to visit. The first thing I did was go and visit the USS Arizona. Here is the photo that I didn't take:

            It was surprising to learn that of all the damage done at Pearl Harbor, all but 3 of the ships damaged or sunk were returned to action. The attack itself was surprisingly ineffective strategically since the American aircraft carriers were not in port and the day of the battleship was largely passed.
