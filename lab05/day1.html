            My first day in Honolulu was a pretty basic day. Honestly I didn't do that much other than spending the day doing what you'd think you'd do in Hawaii: visiting the beach. I went and visited the Waikiki beach. It was very beautiful. Look at this picture I didn't take:

            Anyways, I rented a paddle board and paddled around for a while until I got bored and then I decided to go in the water for a while. I got bored of that again and then walk along the beach. That is where I didn't take this photo:

        <h3 class="content-text">Yeah... Overall, I'd say my first day was okay. Beaches aren't really my thing. I think tomorrow I will go and visit Pearl Harbor.</h3>
