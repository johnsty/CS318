        <h3 class="content-text">
            My fourth day, the last and final day of my fake trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, was pretty simple. I spent most of the morning just laying on the beach. After I went and got lunch I decided instead of shreading the waves surfing like I did yesterday, I should go paddle boarding again since it was more laid back. So I met some random person and talked to them for a while. Then we went paddle boarding as you can see by this photo I didn't take:

           At some point, the random stranger I met fell of and I lost them. So then I went back to the beach and decided to see a Hula Show, because I wasn't sure what else to do. This is a photo of an example show:

            It was really nice spending my last day in a relaxing enviroment. After visiting Pearl Harbor and shredding the ocean waves yesterday, I needed a day off. I wonder if I will ever come back to Hawaii?
