                    <p>Alex first began playin the guitar just after he turned 6. He is a third generation musician in his family, and was inspired to play after hearing his father play.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in a small town in Wisconsin made it tough for Alex to get a big following. So he moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin in pursuit of his dreams. He first started playing in small clubs around the city and making tutorial videos on YouTube. Within a few months, Alex has grown a passionate following.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, Alex has began writing his own songs, and co-writing songs for the music label Kuoba Music Group (KMG). For KMG, he has worked with artists J. Chrles for hip-hop, and Noman for EDM. Recently, he began writing modern pop music with Emily Austrums and Ty Johnson. He is looking forward to releasing his first EP with them soon.</p>
