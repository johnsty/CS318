                    <p>Why not send your project to Allan and have him record the guitar parts for you at his home studio? All you need to do is provide a brief description of what you'd like to hear, maybe an MP3 or a rough mix, and Allan will do the rest. The finished articles will be sent back to you in the format of your choice to mix into your project. You can even use Skype to work with Allan in real-time as he is recording. </p>
                    <p>Whether it's contemporary pop, vintage blues, RnB or pretty much anything else, Allan has a wealth of musical experience which enables him to bring authentic and creative guitar parts to any track. Allan especially loves to lay down grooving rhythm guitar parts, but of course if you require a catchy melody, funky single note lines, beautiful acoustic textures or FX heavy electric guitars, Allan will work with you to make sure everything sounds just the way you'd like. </p>
                    <p>Alongside state of the art recording equipment, a wide range of guitars, amps, microphones & signal processors are used in order to create gorgeous guitar tones. Allan believes that finding the right sound is just as important as playing the right part, so every effort is made to ensure that both elements complement eachother perfectly. Both "wet" and "dry" versions of the guitar tracks are available in order to give you maximum flexibility when it comes to the final mix. </p>
                    <p>As you can see from the testimonials below, Allan is a versatile and creative player who is knowledgeable and very easy to work with. On every recording session Allan is committed to doing your music justice. No effort is spared to bring the best possible guitar performances to your music. Get in touch to get professional quality guitar parts on your next track.</p>
